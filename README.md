### Hi there! 😁

My name is Pedro Augusto Montes from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been coding as Front-End Developer since 2019 and currently I'm looking for a job at [ZUP](https://zup.com.br). I'm passionate about open source projects, design, new challenges and I always try to escape the comfort zone, trying to become a person outside the curve who always seeks learning and is happy to help others.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) games (:video_game:), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me? 💬
